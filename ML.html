    <h1>Machine Learning</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Machine learning (ML)</b>  is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. 
        It is seen as a part of artificial intelligence. 
        Machine learning algorithms build a model based on sample data, known as "training data", in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. <br>
         Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications, such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or unfeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks.

        A subset of machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers; but not all machine learning is statistical learning. 
        The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory and application domains to the field of machine learning. 
        Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning. 
        In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.
